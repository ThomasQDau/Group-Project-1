#### THINGS TO THINK ABOUT ####
- Using a face recognition API to create a website where users who are in the database already can log into their system
    - EXAMPLE: Access to building, clocking in to work, signing in for the gym, signing into online classroom, accessing public computer
    - Basically a form of identification that is more secure than using a username/pw to prevent unwanted guests.
    - Or to really keep track if someone is going to class/or if a worker is really clocking in at a specific time.

## EXAMPLE ONE: GYM
- User already signs up with gym with all of their information
- Instead of checking in by writing their name or a barcode, they stand in front of a camera to sign in.
- This prevents someone else from using their membership

## EXAMPLE TWO: Work
- User should already be in the system with their information
- Instead of coworker clocking in someone else so they hit their hour mark, a face scan is used to know time/date of arrival/departure.
- If worker claims hours were wrong, the face scan would have all the information about it.

## EXAMPLE THREE: School/Online School/SAT test etc
- Again, user should already be in the system
- Face scans them in order to attend class so someone else isn't checking in for them or taking an important exam for them
- Taking away risk of fake ID and such

## EXAMPLE FOUR: Video Game log in credentials (Tournaments or boosting)
- Face is already tied to account
- When logging in, a face scan is used to verify user
- This prevents someone else from helping user or boosting user to a higher level from fraudelently using their account against game TOS

#### WEB BUILDING ####
- Front page: What is it?
- Links to include: Information, applications, benefits, case studies (ID theft, fraud -- maybe using chart.js: https://www.chartjs.org/)
- ID theft stats: https://idtheftinfo.org/id-theft-statistics-a-studies
